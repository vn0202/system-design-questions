# Problem Statement

Design a video processing pipeline for a Video Streaming service starting from upload, storage, process, post-process, on-demand processing, and caching. The core of this problem statement is to design the system in such a way that the processing of videos post upload is done with massive parellization.

# Requirements

<!--rs-->
*The problem statement is something to start with, be creative and dive into the product details and add constraints and features you think would be important.*
<!--re-->

## Core Requirements

 - ability to processes thousands of videos in parallel
 - design a robust video upload flow

##  High Level Requirements
<!--hs-->
- make your high-level components operate with **high availability**
 - ensure that the data in your system is **durable**, not matter what happens
 - define how your system would behave while **scaling-up** and **scaling-down**
 - make your system **cost-effective** and provide a justification for the same
 - describe how **capacity planning** helped you made a good design decision 
 - think about how other services will interact with your service
<!--he-->

##  Micro Requirements
<!--ms-->
- ensure the data in your system is **never** going in an inconsistent state
 - ensure your system is **free of deadlocks** (if applicable)
 - ensure that the throughput of your system is not affected by **locking**, if it does, state how it would affect
<!--me-->

# Output

## Design Document
<!--ds-->
Create a **design document** of this system/feature stating all critical design decisions, tradeoffs, components, services, and communications. Also specify how your system handles at scale, and what will eventually become a chokepoint.

Do **not** create unnecessary components, just to make design look complicated. A good design is **always simple and elegant**. A good way to think about it is if you were to create a spearate process/machine/infra for each component and you will have to code it yourself, would you still do it?
<!--de-->

## Prototype

To understand the nuances and internals of this system, understand

- how CDN streams the video
- how on-demand video optimization works
- how caching strategy is designined for video streaming service


# Outcome

##  You'll learn

- CDN for video streaming
- designing a robust upload flow of video
- parellel processing of a complex workflow
